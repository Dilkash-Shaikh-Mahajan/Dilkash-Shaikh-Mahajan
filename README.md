## Hi 👋 I am Dilkash 
I am a MERN Stack Developer who is passionate about stuff like responsive design and Asynchronous internet. Few technology that I enjoy working in are ReactJS, MongoDB, NodeJS, HTML, and Express(NodeJS Framework). I am actively looking for opportunities in MERN Stack Development. Recently, I have just started with tech-blogging!
- 👨🏽‍💻 Currently working, learning and growing my skillset in MERN Stack Development.

## MERN Stack Development?

- **M** = MongoDB (We'll use Mongoose to make it easier for Node.js to work with MongoDB, and we'll use MongoDB Atlas = MongoDB database, but cloud).
- **E** = Express (makes it easier to work with Node.js. We'll use `cors` middleware to access other servers outside our server).
- **R** = React (for the frontend. We'll use `bootstrap` for styling, `react-router-dom` for React routes, `react-datepicker` for React Datepicker component, and `axios` to connect to the backend).
- **N** = Node.js (for the server. We'll use `dotenv` to load environment variables from an .env file into `process.env`, and `nodemon` to make the app auto-restart when you edit/save files).
